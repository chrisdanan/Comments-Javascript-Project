# Comments-Javascript-Project
Author:   Christopher Danan
Date:     February 2015

This project is taken straight from the Learning Web App Development book by Semmy Purewal.
It is a simple web application that allows a user to enter a comment in an input box and submit
it as a new comment to a list of comments.

This README is informal on purpose and does not reflect my ability to write README's.
